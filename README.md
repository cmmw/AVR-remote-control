A simple two-button 44kHz remote control (using an ATTINY85 microcntroller) for my television which is capable of copying two signals from the original tv-remote control.
Holding both buttons for about two seconds will activate the green LED for one second to indicate that the remote control is waiting for two signals to copy. 
(Only tested on my Grundig Television).
